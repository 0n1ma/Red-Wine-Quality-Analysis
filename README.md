# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis
This project explores the relationships between chemical properties in red wine quality. This analysis applies association measures, correlation tests, and regression modeling to identify which variables have a greater influence on wine quality.

# Objectives
- Understand how chemical propoerties affect wine quality
- Quantify relationships between variables using association and correlation tests, which was my primary role in this project
- Build and interpret a multiple regreeion model to predict wine quality
- Visualize patterns to supprt statistical findings

# Dataset
- Wine Quality Dataset
- 1,599 red wines from Portugal's Vinho Verde region
- 11 numerical predictors and 1 quality score

# Analysis
- Cleaning: handled missing values and standardized variables types
- Association and Correlation: computed correlation matrix to identify strongly related features and found notable associations
- Regression: built a multiple linear regression model using significant predictors and evaluated model performance
- Visualization: pair plots and correlation heatmaps; scatterplots of key associations

# Insights
- Alcohol content had the strongest positive relationship with wine quality
- Volatile acidity and density were negatively associated with quality
